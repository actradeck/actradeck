# ADR 0012: Threat model — single-operator / local-fs / loopback; advisory locks; 0600 atomic writes

- Status: Accepted
- Source: decision `019ea476` (threat model), `019ee68f` (fs-atomic); `apps/sidecar/src/file-lock.ts`

## Context

The sidecar writes state files, lock files, and per-launch token files locally, and
it runs an approval gate. These guarantees need a stated trust boundary; without one,
"is it secure?" has no answerable scope.

## Decision

The threat model is **single-operator / local-fs / loopback**. Within that boundary:

- **Concurrency.** Cross-process read-modify-write (multiple daemons touching the
  same file during `systemctl` restarts, etc.) is serialized with an **advisory file
  lock** (`O_EXCL` create, pid-based stale detection, fail-loud on timeout).
- **At-rest secrecy.** Secret/token-bearing state files are written **`0600`** via a
  single shared atomic helper — `writeJson0600` (temp-write → `rename`) — so all
  such writers share one audited implementation instead of drifting copies.
- **Approvals** fail safe on timeout (ask/deny).

Explicitly **out of scope**: pid-spoofing resistance, and isolation between mutually
distrusting local users with the same privileges as the agent.

## Consequences

- Lost-update and partial-write are prevented within the boundary; this is **not** a
  defense against a hostile local user at equal privilege.
- The boundary is documented in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md).
- Every `0600` atomic writer must go through `writeJson0600`; re-hand-rolling
  temp+rename+chmod is drift and is rejected in review.
